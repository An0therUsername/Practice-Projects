# Hangman 2.0
'''
Hangman is a game for two people in which one player thinks of a word and then draws a blank line on the page for each letter in the word. The second player then tries to guess letters that might be in the word. If the second player guesses the letter correctly, the first player writesÂ  the letter in the proper blank. But if the second player guesses incorrectly, the first player draws a single body part of a hanging man. The second player has to guess all the letters in the word before the hanging man is completely drawn to win the game. 

===========================

This version has the following extended features:
    + Select difficulty and determine the number of possible failures
    + Select category of words to guess
